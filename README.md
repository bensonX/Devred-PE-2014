Devred-PE-2014
==============

A small experiment around the [Spring-Summer 2014 Devred Collection](http://www.devred.com/looks-saison-4893.r.html). The motivation behind this application was to develop a list view that can be used over another component that need touch events, like a [MapView](http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView.html) or a [PhotoView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView).

Concept and result
==============

###[Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko4aaXUqtMw)

To achieve what we wanted to do, we simply set some padding to the top of the ListView and override onTouchEvent so that the method does not handle the motion event if it occurs "above" the first child.

    @Override
    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
        boolean handled = super.onTouchEvent(ev);
        View child = getChildAt(0);
        if (child != null && ev.getY() < child.getY()) {
            handled = false;
        }
        return handled;
    }

And that's it! Pretty simple, but we think that's a cool feature to use when the content needs space and touch interactivity at the same time =)

TODO
==============
* Resize drawables.
* Use density-specific resources.
* and much more...
